This causes global warming and climate change. Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels and industry have increased significantly since 2000, and in 2019 reached a record high of 36.7 billion metric tons of CO2. In December 2015, private companies and governments all over the world committed to minimize the increase of global temperature in the <span class="font-bold">Paris Agreement</span>. </p></div><div class="flex-1 bg-white p-8"><h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600"> What is Carbon Trading? </h4><p class="mt-4"> Carbon trading is an activity of buying and selling carbon credits, in which typically the buyer produces carbon emissions that exceed the specified limit, or have their personal target to become a net zero or carbon neutral individual or company. A carbon credit is a representation of the &#39;right&#39; for a company to emit a certain amount of carbon or other greenhouse gas emissions in its industrial processes. One unit of carbon credit is equivalent to a reduction in emissions of 1 tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2). </p></div></div>',1),k={class:"relative md:static mt-6 md:mt-12 text-center"},q=e("div",{class:"h-24 md:h-80"},null,-1),A={__name:"about",setup(C){return r({title:"About Us",meta:[{name:"description",content:"1 billion+ tonnes of GHG needs to be sequestered every year"}]}),(H,O)=>{const s=n;return d(),l("div",c,[m,e("section",null,[e("div",h,[e("div",p,[u,e("div",x,[a(s,{type:"round"},{default:o(()=>[t("Our Products")]),_:1})])]),e("div",b,[g,f,e("div",v,[a(s,{type:"round",class:"mt-8"},{default:o(()=>[t("See More")]),_:1})])])])]),e("section",null,[e("div",_,[y,e("div",w,[G,e("div",k,[a(s,{type:"round",class:"absolute md:static top-4 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 md:translate-x-0"},{default:o(()=>[t(" See More ")]),_:1})])])]),q])])}}};export{A as default};
